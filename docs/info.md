## How it works

This project is an 8-bit custom processor designed in Verilog. It includes essential components such as:

   Program Counter (PC): Keeps track of instruction addresses.

   Control Unit: Decodes instructions and generates control signals.

   ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit): Performs arithmetic and logic operations.

   Register File: Stores and retrieves 8-bit data values.

   The processor fetches instructions, decodes them, performs operations via the ALU, and stores results. All actions are synchronized with the clock input.

## How to test

To test this processor:

   Ensure all Verilog files are in the correct directories.

   Navigate to the test/ folder.

   Use make to run the cocotb testbench:

cd test
make

The testbench sets input values and verifies output through assertions.

You can modify the test.py file to check different inputs and behaviors.

## External hardware

Not applicable â€” this project runs entirely in simulation and does not require external hardware.
